    The slider features a rotating carousel with three high-quality, casino-themed images. The images have a text overlay which features the welcome offer and a register cta button. The slider rotates automatically every 5 seconds using JavaScript, with smooth fade-in transitions done using css keyframe animations.

2.  **Three step process**
    This section guides users on how to get started through a clear, step by step registration process.
    Each step card features a staggered pop-in animation using css keyframes animantion that makes the process visually engaging. On hover, additional effects such as slight scaling and color transitions enhance the interactive feel, ensuring the userâ€™s focus is drawn sequentially to each step.

3.  **Games & Services Cards**
    This section features 3 cards highlighting the different offerings at the casino. Each card uses vibrant gradients and hover effects such as scaling, shadow intensification, and image zoom to create a tactile interface.

4.  **Call-to-Action (CTA) Section**
    The final section features a clear CTA inviting users to register and benefit from exclusive casino offers. The CTA section uses similar gradient backgrounds, hover effects on the button, and smooth transitions to be consistent with the overal design.

## Additional Interactive Elements

1. **Scroll-to-Top Arrow**
   Because the page is scrollable, a fixed scroll-to-top arrow appears after 300px of scrolling down. When clicked this arrow scrolls the page back to the top using smooth transitions thus making navigation effortless.

2. **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**
   A toggle button in the top-right corner allows users to switch between dark and light modes. In dark mode (the default), the page uses the rich, casino-inspired palette. In light mode, colors adjust for a brighter, more modern look.
